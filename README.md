# 🐳 Docker Mastery

Welcome to my **Docker Mastery** journey! This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of notes, examples, and configuration files created while mastering Docker and container orchestration.

## 🎯 Repository Purpose

This repo is a living document of my progress, containing:

- **Core Concepts**: Understanding images, containers, and layers.
- **Workflow**: Dockerfiles, image building, and registry management.
- **Networking**: Bridging, host, and overlay networks.
- **Persistence**: [Volumes and bind mounts](./docker_volumes/README.md).
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose and basic Swarm/K8s concepts.
- **Best Practices**: Security, optimization, and multi-stage builds.

## 📂 Modules

Explore detailed notes and examples for each topic:

- 💾 [**Docker Volumes & Data**](./docker_volumes/) - Data persistence, bind mounts, and volumes.
